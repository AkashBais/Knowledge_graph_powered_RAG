# Knowledge_graph_powered_RAG
## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Project
### Overview
This project is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to parse standard PDF documents. It helps parse your PDF documents and also enhance the knowledge in them with relevant WEB search . **The system is equipped with a Knowledge Graph backend, replacing the traditional vector store**, which enhances its ability to parse PDF documents[while retaining its structural information] and supplement its sections with relevant web search results.

### Features
Knowledge Graph Backend: Utilizes a Knowledge Graph for enhanced information retrieval above simple similarity search.< br / >
Summarization: Provides concise and accurate summaries of the information gathered.< br / >
Enhanced Information Retrieval: Supplements parsed document sections with relevant web search results for comprehensive answers.< br / >
Multi-Model type support: It lets you initilize one of a Hugging Face LLM, Gimini as LLM, or A GGUF model to run on CPU based systems.< br / >
### How It Works
Document Input: Users input their document of interest. The system parces it and extracts relevant headers and section text for those headers< br / >
Web Search: The system performs relevant web searches to gather suplimental information for the headers.< br / >
Knowledge Graph Integration: Utilizes the Knowledge Graph to parse and understand PDF documents for better retrival.< br / >
Information Synthesis: Analyzes and summarizes the gathered information to provide a coherent response.< br / >
Response Generation: Delivers a personalized and concise answer to the userâ€™s query.< br / >
### Use Cases
Interacting with your PDF documents < br / >
